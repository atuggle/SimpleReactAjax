# SimpleReactAjax
Very simple React app that pulls down a list of countries and on change shows the states for that country using Fetch

Used React to display a dropdown of countries pulled from a rest api on Heroku in JSON format.  On the selection of a country a second drop down is populated with a list of states for that country pulled from another rest heroku api using a POST action

Here is a good REACT page life cycle tutorial:
